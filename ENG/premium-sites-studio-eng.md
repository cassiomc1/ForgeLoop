# Premium Websites at Studio Level — Complete Process

> This guide defines the production process. For detailed visual rules, also use [`design-code-eng.md`](./design-code-eng.md). For accessibility, code quality, testing, security, and performance, consult the related documents at the end. A high-end website is not only a beautiful interface: it is a coherent, useful, fast, accessible, measurable, and maintainable experience.
>
> **Tooling policy**: identify the stack, the stage, and the applicable checks; prefer an already available equivalent that produces compatible evidence. Ask for authorization before installing a tool or changing the environment. If no safe equivalent exists, record the required check as blocked and never claim that it passed. Do not install merely optional resources.

## 1. Quality bar

A website is ready only when it meets all of these criteria at the same time:

- **Clarity:** within seconds, people understand what it is, who it is for, and what action they can take.
- **Intent:** every section, image, animation, and word has a business or experience purpose.
- **Coherence:** brand, content, interface, motion, responsiveness, and behavior form one system.
- **Distinctiveness:** the solution has its own visual and narrative idea; it is not a recolored template.
- **Inclusion:** keyboard, screen reader, zoom, contrast, reduced motion, and different devices are considered from the start.
- **Performance:** the experience is fast on the audience's real devices and networks, not only on the developer's computer.
- **Reliability:** loading, error, empty, consent, form, and integration states behave predictably.
- **Operations:** someone can update content, measure results, fix problems, and evolve the site after launch.

## 2. How to use this guide

Follow the gates in order. Within each gate, use the canonical [Loop Engineering](../LOOP_ENGINEERING.md) cycle; do not start costly implementation before the previous gate has a verifiable output or recorded uncertainty.

1. **Brief and strategy:** objective, audience, positioning, offer, constraints, and metrics.
2. **Content and architecture:** content inventory, sitemap, navigation, journeys, and data model.
3. **Creative direction:** concept, references, tone, imagery, typography, color, composition, and motion.
4. **Design system:** tokens, components, states, breakpoints, usage rules, and recorded decisions.
5. **Prototype and validation:** test hierarchy, comprehension, navigation, and conversion before full implementation.
6. **Implementation:** build with semantic HTML, predictable components, real or representative data, and progressive enhancement.
7. **Quality:** run accessibility, performance, security, SEO, compatibility, functional testing, and visual regression.
8. **Launch and operations:** deploy with observability, rollback plan, analytics, documentation, and an accountable owner.

Each gate must have a verifiable output. If a decision remains ambiguous, record the hypothesis, risk, owner, and next test; do not hide uncertainty behind aesthetics.

## 3. Gate 1 — Brief, strategy, and success

Before choosing colors or components, produce a short brief:

```md
# Website brief

## Context
- Brand/product:
- Business problem:
- Why this website exists now:

## Audience
- Primary audience:
- Secondary audiences:
- Prior knowledge:
- Needs and objections:

## Desired outcome
- Primary action:
- Secondary actions:
- Primary metric:
- Quality metrics:

## Constraints
- Available content:
- Technology/CMS:
- Languages and regions:
- Timeline and team:
- Legal, accessibility, and security requirements:

## Non-goals
- What the website does not need to solve:
```

Rules:

- Do not invent positioning, testimonials, numbers, clients, awards, or claims to fill the page.
- Distinguish **objective**, **hypothesis**, and **metric**. “Look premium” is not a sufficient metric.
- Define one primary action per page. If everything is a priority, nothing is.
- Identify what must be approved by the client, user, or legal team before writing the interface.
- Define audience, device, network speed, language, location, and technology as context — not as end-stage details.

## 4. Gate 2 — Content, architecture, and journeys

### Content inventory

Before final layouts, organize a table with:

| Page/section | Purpose | Real content | Source/owner | Status | CTA | Media requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home/hero | Explain proposition | Headline, support, proof | Marketing | approved | Explore product | video/image |

Valid statuses: `draft`, `in review`, `approved`, `blocked`, `outdated`. Placeholder content cannot be treated as ready for visual or conversion QA.

### Information architecture

- Create sitemap, primary navigation, secondary navigation, footer, and return paths.
- Organize around user intent, not the company's internal structure.
- Give every page a title, promise, primary action, and success state.
- Avoid navigation that depends only on hover, gestures, horizontal scrolling, or animation.
- Plan readable URLs, titles, descriptions, headings, breadcrumbs, and social sharing from the architecture stage.
- For CMS sites, model content as reusable data; do not repeat the same copy in multiple components.
- For multilingual sites, treat translation, text expansion, locale, currency, date, SEO, and fallbacks as first-class requirements.

### Critical journeys

Map at least:

- first visit → understanding → exploration → primary action;
- search/navigation → detail page → conversion;
- form → validation → submission → confirmation → error recovery;
- slow mobile device → priority content → essential interaction;
- returning user → update, support, or next action.

## 5. Gate 3 — Creative direction

Produce creative direction before multiplying screens. It must answer:

- What is the experience's central idea?
- What feeling should remain after the visit?
- What visual contrast differentiates the brand?
- What is structural and what is decoration?
- Which references describe language, and which are merely visual copies that are prohibited?
- How does the idea work without imagery, audio, hover, and with reduced motion?

Recommended deliverables:

- an annotated moodboard, not just a collage;
- photography/illustration/3D direction and cropping rules;
- primary and supporting typography with license and fallback;
- semantic color palette and contrast examples;
- composition, rhythm, and density principles;
- storyboard for motion and video moments;
- an explicit list of anti-patterns that do not belong to the brand.

The [premium visual guide](./design-code-eng.md) provides palettes, typography, layout, components, and motion. Use it as an execution system, not as a substitute for strategic direction.

## 6. Gate 4 — Production design system

### Tokens

Define tokens before components:

- brand color, surfaces, text, border, focus, success, warning, error, and information;
- typography by function: display, heading, body, label, caption, and code;
- spacing, container, grid, radius, border, shadow, and elevation scales;
- breakpoints based on behavior, not specific devices;
- motion: duration, easing, distance, stagger, and reduction rules;
- z-index, layers, opacity, and interaction states.

Use semantic tokens (`color.text.primary`) instead of scattering raw values (`#111111`) across components. Dark mode and themes should swap tokens, not require a copied interface.

### Components

Every production component should have:

- purpose, anatomy, and usage rules;
- necessary variants, without infinite cosmetic variants;
- `default`, `hover`, `focus-visible`, `active`, `disabled`, `loading`, `error`, and `success` states when applicable;
- behavior on mobile, keyboard, zoom, long content, and missing media;
- HTML semantics and accessibility contract;
- realistic example data and known limits;
- a test or acceptance criterion;
- a recorded decision when there is a meaningful trade-off.

Do not turn every section into a single disposable component. Componentize real repeated patterns and preserve freedom for special compositions.

### Maturity criterion

A component is not ready because it exists in Figma. It is ready when another person can use it without asking the author how it should behave.

## 7. Gate 5 — UX, prototype, and validation

- Prototype hierarchy, navigation, and critical states first; visual detail comes later.
- Test with near-real content, including long titles, missing images, errors, and small screens.
- Validate five questions: “what is it?”, “is it for me?”, “why trust it?”, “what do I do now?”, and “what happens next?”.
- Observe where people hesitate, not only whether they can click.
- Record decisions and issues by severity: blocker, high, medium, low.
- “Works in my viewport” is not validation.

## 8. Gate 6 — Premium implementation

### Architecture

- Separate content, data, components, layout, tokens, integrations, and media.
- Keep components small, named, and searchable; follow [`clean-code-eng.md`](./clean-code-eng.md).
- Use semantic HTML before ARIA and progressive enhancement for essential content.
- Choose a rendering strategy (static, server-side, hybrid, or client-side) based on content, SEO, personalization, and interaction needs.
- Do not add a framework, animation library, 3D, or CMS just because it is fashionable.
- Treat dependencies, fonts, images, and external scripts as product and security decisions.
- Keep a single source for tokens and content; avoid drift between Figma, code, and CMS.

### Content and media

- Use images and video with documented license, attribution, and purpose.
- Define `alt`, captions, transcript, poster, aspect ratio, focal point, and fallback.
- Reserve media space before loading to avoid layout shift.
- Do not use video, 3D, custom cursors, or parallax to hide a weak proposition.
- Essential content must remain understandable when media is blocked or unavailable.

### Motion

- Motion should explain change, hierarchy, spatial relationship, or feedback; it should not exist only to impress.
- Use entry, continuity, exit, and error states consistently.
- Prefer `transform` and `opacity`, pause work outside the viewport, and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Every essential interaction must work without hover, pointer lock, audio, or complex gestures.
- For trailers, demos, and HTML motion graphics, use [HyperFrames](https://hyperframes.heygen.com) and follow the [official quickstart](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/quickstart). Preserve brand tokens and validate the render as a separate audiovisual product.

## 9. Gate 7 — Technical quality

This guide orchestrates the specialized guides; it does not duplicate them.

| Area | Minimum gate | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code | lint, format, typing, architecture review, and dependency review | [`clean-code-eng.md`](./clean-code-eng.md) |
| Accessibility | keyboard, focus, semantics, contrast, zoom/reflow, screen reader, and `prefers-reduced-motion` | [`accessibility-eng.md`](./accessibility-eng.md) |
| Testing | unit, integration, E2E, accessibility, and visual regression | [`test-code-eng.md`](./test-code-eng.md) |
| Performance | baseline, budgets, Web Vitals, real network/device, and regression | [`perf-code-eng.md`](./perf-code-eng.md) |
| Security | secrets, headers, dependencies, forms, uploads, CSP, and third parties | [`sec-code-eng.md`](./sec-code-eng.md) |
| Design | tokens, components, responsiveness, real content, and Anti-Slop | [`design-code-eng.md`](./design-code-eng.md) |

### Minimum QA matrix

Test critical flows in a documented matrix that includes:

- wide desktop, smaller desktop, tablet, and mobile;
- Chromium/Chrome, Firefox, and Safari when they are in scope;
- keyboard, touch, mouse/trackpad, and screen reader when applicable;
- 200% zoom, reflow, dark mode, high contrast, and reduced motion;
- fast network, constrained network, cold cache, and low-performance device;
- short, long, translated, missing, invalid, and loading content;
- cookies/consent, third-party blocking, and CMS/API failure.

Record browser, device, version, steps, evidence, severity, owner, and status. A beautiful screenshot is not a reproducible test.

## 10. SEO, discovery, and trust

- Every page should have a search intent or a clear reason not to be indexed.
- Use coherent heading hierarchy, unique title/description, canonical, sitemap, robots, and structured data when appropriate.
- Write for people; do not sacrifice clarity for keywords.
- Ensure crawlable links, indexable error states when needed, Open Graph, favicon, manifest, and correct sharing.
- Do not publish claims, reviews, client logos, or structured data without source and authorization.
- Validate accessibility, performance, privacy, and SEO together: a growth tactic that harms trust is a regression.

## 11. Launch and operations

Before deployment, confirm:

- production environment, variables, and secrets are separated;
- domain, TLS, redirects, cache, CDN, and headers are correct;
- analytics has consent, named events, and a privacy plan;
- error monitoring, uptime, Web Vitals, conversion, and forms are monitored;
- CMS backup/export and rollback plan exist;
- editing documentation, owners, dependencies, and content expiry are documented;
- post-deploy smoke tests cover critical pages and journeys;
- there is a plan to update fonts, libraries, content, consent, and dependencies.

Launch is a transition stage, not the end of the project. Schedule a review after real data, stabilization fixes, and an evidence-based improvement cycle.

## 12. Studio anti-patterns

- Starting with the hero before understanding objective, content, and audience.
- Using lorem ipsum, invented numbers, or unlicensed images.
- Copying a visual reference without understanding the logic that makes it good.
- Creating a huge design system without enough product to justify its parts.
- Building every page with different tokens, spacing, and components.
- Using animation to delay content access or prevent navigation.
- Treating desktop as the only version and “responsive” as automatic shrinking.
- Performing QA only at the end, in one browser and on one computer.
- Measuring only local Lighthouse or only conversion, ignoring accessibility and quality.
- Delivering a site that only its author can maintain.

## 13. Template for `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`

```md
## Premium website at studio level

- Read `premium-sites-studio-eng.md` before creating or reviewing pages.
- Close brief, content, architecture, and creative direction before full implementation.
- Use `design-code-eng.md` for tokens, layout, components, and motion.
- Use real or representative content; do not invent claims, logos, metrics, or testimonials.
- Keep content, tokens, components, integrations, and media separate.
- Preserve semantic HTML, keyboard, focus, contrast, zoom, reflow, and reduced motion.
- Validate desktop, mobile, Safari/Firefox/Chromium, constrained network, and long content.
- Run lint, format, tests, accessibility, performance, security, and visual regression checks.
- Document decisions, risks, exceptions, owners, and next tests.
- Before deployment, validate SEO, analytics/consent, headers, TLS, rollback, and smoke tests.
- If the project has HTML video or motion, consult HyperFrames and validate preview/render.
