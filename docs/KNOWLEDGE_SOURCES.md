# Knowledge sources and provenance

Snapshot date: 2026-09-01
Task: `luna-knowledge-pr-correction-20260901-v2`
Target: ForgeLoop 1.8.0 at current `main` state at review start
(`a4360ac9b24b19c74171fdbac3163b892d896484`, tag `v1.8.0`)

This ledger records research inputs for the knowledge-integration review. It is
not an endorsement list, a source-content mirror, or an evidence registry.

## User-provided revised plan

Source: user-provided `FORGELOOP_LUNA_KNOWLEDGE_INTEGRATION_PLAN_REVISED.md`
Availability: task-local specification; not redistributed
Snapshot date: 2026-08-31
Revision/commit: not applicable
License observed: not applicable; user-provided task specification
Role: specification and curation boundary

Accepted concepts:

- candidate → coverage → proven gap → canonical home → minimal change →
  proportional verification;
- explicit context-cost, change-class, licensing, and fail-closed decisions;
- execution-profile, provenance, lifecycle, and publication distinctions.

Skipped concepts:

- none of the plan's instructions were treated as external source material;
  they define this task's scope and acceptance criteria.

Canonical homes:

- `docs/KNOWLEDGE_INTEGRATION_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` for decisions;
- `docs/KNOWLEDGE_SOURCES.md` for provenance;
- existing `ENG/` and protocol documents for operational rules.

Reuse notes:

- The attachment was used as a specification, not copied into a guide.

## Learn UI

URL: [https://learn-ui.com/](https://learn-ui.com/) and the Markdown index at
[https://learn-ui.com/llms.txt](https://learn-ui.com/llms.txt)
Snapshot date: 2026-08-31
Revision/commit: not exposed by the inspected site
License observed: no reuse license was identified in the inspected index and
pages; reuse was therefore not assumed
Role: discovery and research-only

Accepted concepts:

- prompts to check focus lifecycle, semantic representation, component states,
  feedback, reduced motion, responsive behavior, and perceived performance;
- independent, generalized guide refinements recorded in the gap matrix and
  canonical accessibility/design guides.

Skipped concepts:

- source wording, examples, code, illustrations, page-specific constants,
  visual recipes, and any source-exclusive taxonomy;
- any claim that the site supplies a license or authorizes redistribution.

Canonical homes:

- `ENG/accessibility-eng.md` for objective keyboard, focus, semantic, and
  status guidance;
- `ENG/design-code-eng.md` for contextual component-state guidance;
- existing performance and testing guides where equivalent coverage already
  exists.

Reuse notes:

- No Learn UI text, code, example, image, or diagram was vendored.
- The accepted wording was written from the concrete ForgeLoop gap and
  corroborated with primary W3C/WAI/APG material where it became objective.

## System Design Academy

URL: [https://github.com/systemdesign42/system-design-academy](https://github.com/systemdesign42/system-design-academy)
Snapshot date: 2026-08-31
Revision/commit: `62cca085d6f5d7df1cfaf72c81f7304be9b9386e` (`main` at snapshot)
License observed: `CC BY-NC-ND 4.0`, as declared by the repository license
Role: discovery-only

Accepted concepts:

- broad topic discovery for context engineering, state/recovery, evaluation,
  retries/idempotency, and distributed-system boundaries;
- a prompt to verify each topic against ForgeLoop's existing canonical home.

Skipped concepts:

- all source-specific articles, prose, examples, diagrams, taxonomies, and
  adaptations;
- new protocol, router, profile, schema, evidence, or orchestration behavior;
- a parallel knowledge library or technology-specific guide.

Canonical homes:

- existing `LOOP_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`, `EXECUTION_STATE.md`,
  `PROTOCOL_INTEGRATION.md`, `GUIDE_ROUTER.md`, `QUALITY_SCORECARD.md`,
  `docs/EXECUTION_PROFILE_BENCHMARKS.md`, and current `ENG/` guides.

Reuse notes:

- This repository was used only to discover generic candidate topics.
- Nothing from the repository was copied, translated, closely paraphrased,
  diagrammed, or adapted.

Snapshot date: 2026-08-31
Revision/commit: current web pages; no repository revision used
License observed: primary standards/reference pages; no source text was
reproduced
Role: normative corroboration

Accepted concepts:

- keyboard operation and focus order;
- focus visibility, dialog focus management, reflow, reduced-motion, and
  status-announcement boundaries;
- the distinction between automated checks and human assistive-technology
  evaluation.

Skipped concepts:

- copying normative prose or presenting guide checks as certification;
- claims of legal compliance, conformance, or human testing without scoped
  evidence.

Canonical homes:

- `ENG/accessibility-eng.md` for implementation guidance;
- `ENG/test-code-eng.md` for the automation-plus-human verification boundary.

Reuse notes:

- Links are retained for corroboration; no standards text, test result, or
  certification claim is embedded.

## Cross-source reuse boundary

- No source text, source code, source examples, diagrams, or images are stored
  in this repository as a result of this review.
- External ideas remain research inputs until independently abstracted,
  mapped to a current canonical home, and supported by a proven operational
  gap.
- Subjective judgments such as “premium,” “polished,” or “sophisticated” stay
  advisory and cannot become completion evidence.
- Licensing status is recorded only as observed at the snapshot; it is not
  inferred, upgraded, or used as permission to redistribute material.
