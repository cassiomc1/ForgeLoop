# Knowledge integration gap analysis

Snapshot date: 2026-09-01
Target package: ForgeLoop 1.8.0
Baseline: current `main` state at review start (`a4360ac9b24b19c74171fdbac3163b892d896484`, tag `v1.8.0`)
Task: `luna-knowledge-pr-correction-20260901-v2`

This is the repository-only audit of the revised Luna knowledge-integration plan. It
records what was reviewed, where the current system already has coverage, and
why a concept was integrated, skipped, or deferred. The earlier plan snapshot
was treated as context, not as a version lock; the baseline above is the
execution baseline.

## Method and boundaries

The review followed this sequence:

```text
source → candidate → current canonical home → gap proof → change class → verification
```

The candidate budget stopped at 15 high-quality candidates. P0 UI candidates
were reviewed first. System-design and software-engineering candidates were
then checked against the existing router, execution-profile, state, evidence,
security, performance, testing, and observability contracts. No source text,
source examples, taxonomy, or diagrams were vendored.

The execution profile was resolved as `balanced` from `auto`, with the
accessibility and performance risk reasons preserved by the task route. The
profile changed context depth only; it did not change lifecycle, evidence,
authority, provenance, safety-floor, or completion semantics.

Decision values are `SKIP`, `REFINE`, `EXTEND`, `ADD`, `TEST_ONLY`, `DOC_ONLY`,
`MOVE`, `REMOVE`, and `FOLLOW_UP`. Verification classes describe the kind of
claim a rule can support; they are not completion evidence by themselves.

## Candidate matrix

| Topic | Source | Current home | Coverage at baseline | Gap proof | Corroboration | Operational effect | Verification class | Context cost | Change class | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Focus order and sequential navigation | Learn UI research; WAI-ARIA APG keyboard guidance | `ENG/accessibility-eng.md` — Operable; Verification workflow | Partial: keyboard operation and visible focus were explicit, but traversal order and positive `tabindex` were not | The baseline guide had no focused rule for DOM/visual order or positive `tabindex`; a keyboard audit could therefore reach an inconsistent path without a named failure mode | [APG keyboard interface](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/); WCAG 2.4.3 and 2.4.7 | Makes keyboard traversal predictable and gives reviewers a direct check | REQUIREMENT / CHECKABLE | LOW | GUIDE_ONLY | EXTEND |
| Focus restoration after dynamic removal | Learn UI modal research; WAI-ARIA APG dialog guidance | `ENG/accessibility-eng.md` — Leaked focus traps; Complex component protocol | Partial: move, trap, return, and background exclusion were present, but the return target was assumed to remain available | No fallback was stated for a trigger that is removed, disabled, or no longer meaningful while the dialog is open | [APG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/); WCAG 2.4.3 and 2.4.11 | Prevents focus loss after destructive, asynchronous, or route-changing dialog flows | REQUIREMENT / CHECKABLE | LOW | GUIDE_ONLY | EXTEND |
| Dialog initial focus and inactive background | Learn UI modal research; WAI-ARIA APG dialog guidance | `ENG/accessibility-eng.md` — Operable; Leaked focus traps | Partial: focus movement and keyboard containment were present, but initial-focus intent and the lifecycle decision were not separately discoverable | The guide did not tell an implementer to choose an initial target according to the dialog task or to make the outside subtree non-interactive using the platform-equivalent mechanism | [APG dialog pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/); WCAG 2.4.3 | Reduces focus jumps and background interaction during overlays | REQUIREMENT / CHECKABLE | LOW | GUIDE_ONLY | REFINE |
| Composite informative visuals | Learn UI accessibility research; WAI semantics guidance | `ENG/accessibility-eng.md` — Alt text; Semantic HTML | Partial: informative images and decorative icons were covered, but a rich visual made of many DOM nodes had no single semantic-representation rule | The baseline did not define how to expose one meaningful description while hiding decorative lines, labels, or illustration fragments from the accessibility tree | [WAI-ARIA APG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/); WCAG 1.1.1 and 4.1.2 | Avoids duplicate or noisy announcements without removing meaningful information | REQUIREMENT / CHECKABLE | LOW | GUIDE_ONLY | EXTEND |
| Code examples and status controls | Learn UI accessibility research; WAI status guidance | `ENG/accessibility-eng.md` — Dynamic feedback; Semantic HTML | Partial: live-region timing and native controls were covered, but code presentation, line-number noise, copy controls, and their status relationship were not | A code sample could satisfy the generic image/control rules while still exposing redundant line numbers or an unlabeled copy result | [WAI ARIA22 status technique](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA22.html); WCAG 4.1.3 | Keeps examples navigable and makes copy/result feedback observable without relying on visual change | REQUIREMENT / CHECKABLE | LOW | GUIDE_ONLY | EXTEND |
| Component state map and asynchronous outcomes | Learn UI component-state research; existing design guide | `ENG/design-code-eng.md` — semantic states; progressive-enhancement contract; `ENG/test-code-eng.md` — journey states | Partial: many states were named in separate sections, but there was no compact method for mapping only the states a component can reach | The baseline had no state-map heading that connects resting, interaction, availability, data, and async outcome states to review and testing | Existing design and test rules for states, loading, errors, and interaction feedback | Makes loading/success/error/empty and selected/expanded behavior explicit without requiring irrelevant states | CONTEXTUAL / CHECKABLE | LOW | GUIDE_ONLY | EXTEND |
| Interrupted or retargeted motion | Learn UI toast research; existing motion rules | `ENG/design-code-eng.md` — Motion; progressive enhancement | Strong enough for this task: motion duration, easing, reduced motion, fallback, and state-transition guidance existed; no current product component exposed a proven missing behavior | No consumer or reproducible defect justified a new motion-state contract beyond the state-map refinement | Existing design motion rules and `prefers-reduced-motion` checks | No immediate operational gain over the existing guidance | HEURISTIC / CONTEXTUAL | MEDIUM | NONE | SKIP |
| Reduced-motion distinction between ambient and essential interaction | Learn UI performance/accessibility research; WCAG 2.3.3 | `ENG/accessibility-eng.md` — Motion; `ENG/design-code-eng.md` — Motion and progressive enhancement | Strong: the guides require the preference, static alternatives, and preservation of content and action | Keyword and heading audit found equivalent coverage; adding another rule would duplicate the canonical motion contract | [WCAG animation from interactions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html) | No new behavior or context value at this time | REQUIREMENT / CHECKABLE | MEDIUM | NONE | SKIP |
| Responsive reflow, viewport, and touch behavior | Learn UI craft research; WCAG reflow | `ENG/design-code-eng.md` — Web Mobile; UX checklist; `ENG/accessibility-eng.md` — Zoom and reflow | Strong: viewport, touch targets, gesture alternatives, 320 CSS px reflow, and 200% zoom were present | No consumer-specific failure or missing canonical rule was found | [WCAG reflow](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reflow.html) | No new behavior or context value at this stage | REQUIREMENT / CHECKABLE | MEDIUM | NONE | SKIP |
| Visual hierarchy and typography | Learn UI craft/taste research | `ENG/design-code-eng.md` — Principles, typography, layout, and review checklist; `ENG/taste-frontend-eng.md` | Strong for a general guide; subjective taste remains advisory | The source supplied inspiration, not a reproducible ForgeLoop requirement or a product-specific deficiency | Existing design tokens, hierarchy, typography, and taste boundaries | Avoids adding subjective evidence or another visual guide | SUBJECTIVE / CONTEXTUAL | MEDIUM | NONE | SKIP |
| Progressive enhancement and perceived performance | Learn UI performance research; existing performance guide | `ENG/design-code-eng.md` — progressive-enhancement contract; `ENG/perf-code-eng.md` — measurement, assets, animation, APIs | Strong: fallback, capability checks, render cost, budgets, and real-condition measurement were already canonical | No missing principle or measured performance problem was found in this documentation-only task | Existing design/performance contracts and performance checks | No new context or benchmark need | HEURISTIC / CHECKABLE | MEDIUM | NONE | SKIP |
| Context selection and execution-profile safety | System Design Academy discovery; current implementation | `GUIDE_ROUTER.md`; execution-profile core; `LOOP_ENGINEERING.md`; `ORCHESTRATOR_INTEGRATION.md` | Strong: deterministic signals, reason codes, exclusions, safety floor, balanced resolution, and lazy optional context were present | No false activation, unknown/duplicate failure, under-selection, or safety-floor defect was reproduced | Current router/profile implementation, profile benchmarks, and task preflight | Preserves selective context and avoids protocol churn | PROTOCOL | HIGH | NONE | SKIP |
| State, memory, recovery, and continuity separation | System Design Academy discovery; current state model | `LOOP_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`; `EXECUTION_STATE.md`; `PROTOCOL_INTEGRATION.md` | Strong: serialized task state, events, receipt/work-state, continuity, recovery, provenance, and freshness are separated | No path was found that lets recovery imply completion, stale evidence survive, or chat memory replace canonical state | Current state schemas, lifecycle rules, and recovery tests | No architecture change justified | PROTOCOL / EVIDENCE_CAPABLE | HIGH | NONE | SKIP |
| Evaluation versus product verification | System Design Academy discovery; current scorecard/benchmarks | `QUALITY_SCORECARD.md`; `docs/EXECUTION_PROFILE_BENCHMARKS.md`; `LOOP_ENGINEERING.md` | Strong: process efficiency, host/provider telemetry, product verification, and completion evidence are distinct | No evidence path was found that converts subjective quality, agent report, or benchmark output into completion truth | Existing scorecard, benchmark schemas, and evidence semantics | Prevents metric inflation and preserves fail-closed completion | EVIDENCE_CAPABLE / SUBJECTIVE | HIGH | NONE | SKIP |
| Retries, idempotency, concurrency, and distributed edges | System Design Academy discovery; performance/security/test guides | `ENG/clean-code-eng.md`; `ENG/perf-code-eng.md`; `ENG/sec-code-eng.md`; `ENG/test-code-eng.md`; protocol durable-action rules | Strong for the current reusable guidance: timeouts, cancellation, backpressure, idempotency, retry budgets, cache isolation, queues, webhooks/WebSockets, and test boundaries are already represented | No active implementation consumer or reproducible gap justified deeper topic-specific guidance; expanding now would increase context without changing a decision | Existing canonical guides and durable-action contracts | Revisit only with a concrete system consumer, schema, benchmark, or failure case | CHECKABLE / PROTOCOL | HIGH | NONE | FOLLOW_UP |

## Decisions and write set

The proven gaps are small documentation gaps, not missing runtime capabilities:

- Extend `ENG/accessibility-eng.md` with focus order, focus lifecycle fallback,
  dialog initial-focus intent, composite visual semantics, and code/status
  semantics.
- Extend `ENG/design-code-eng.md` with a compact, context-sensitive component
  state-map rule that connects reachable states to interaction and review.
- Keep the test guide unchanged because its existing keyboard, focus, state,
  reflow, reduced-motion, manual-evaluation, and evidence-boundary rules are
  sufficient for these guide-only changes.
- Keep `GUIDE_ROUTER.md`, execution profiles, protocol files, schemas, and
  evidence vocabulary unchanged. No new evidence ID or preflight gate is
  justified.
- Keep this gap analysis as a repository-only research audit and exclude it
  from the npm package because it is task-specific and would add shipped
  context without runtime value.
- Keep the source ledger as permanent, packaged provenance documentation
  because it records the licensing boundary and prevents repeating the same
  source review.

The final guide wording is independently formulated. The Learn UI material is
research-only because reuse permission was not confirmed. System Design
Academy is discovery-only because its repository declares `CC BY-NC-ND 4.0`.
Objective accessibility rules are corroborated with W3C/WAI/APG references.

## Verification plan

The selected changes are `GUIDE_ONLY` plus documentation inventory updates.
They require documentation checks, focused semantic inspection, and a
negative-first diff review. They do not require profile benchmarks, router
fixtures, schema tests, protocol regressions, or executable product tests
because no runtime or protocol behavior changes.

The review must continue to reject these false conclusions:

- a guide statement is not completion evidence;
- a screenshot is not proof of visual quality;
- an agent report is not independent process execution;
- a status-region rule is not proof that assistive-technology testing occurred;
- a balanced profile does not authorize skipping lifecycle or evidence gates;
- a recovery artifact, stale result, or committed file does not imply
  completion.
