# Revision Providers

Revision providers supply the exact source snapshot used by ForgeLoop code
manifests and revision-range coverage. The interface is source-control-host
neutral; Git is the first implementation.

## Contract

A provider must expose these methods:

```js
{
  detect(target),
  getCurrentRevision(target),
  getChangedEntries({ target, baseRevision, headRevision, paths }),
  readContent({ target, revision, path }),
  getContentIdentity({ target, revision, path }),
  getRepositoryIdentity(target)
}
```

Changed entries use normalized forward-slash paths and carry an operation,
content kind, optional raw bytes, an optional provider content identity, and
provider metadata. Provider revision identifiers are opaque to ForgeLoop.

## Git provider

The built-in `git` provider handles:

- worktree, commit, index, and opaque revision reads;
- exact raw bytes for files and symlink targets;
- deletion, rename, copy, type-change, and Gitlink entries;
- Git object identity when it is available;
- literal path arguments through `execFile`, without shell interpolation.

Select it explicitly in a range check:

```bash
forgeloop attestation-verify-range \
  --revision-provider git \
  --base origin/main \
  --head HEAD \
  --require-complete-coverage
```

Git metadata is an implementation detail of this provider. The attestation
core does not import Git helpers and can accept a future snapshot or
content-addressable provider without changing the statement schema.

## Differential Verification Scope

The provider boundary has two consumers with different semantics:

1. Differential Verification uses current changed entries or effective task
   claims to decide which paths one checker may execute before completion.
2. Attestation and revision-range coverage use exact content and valid task
   attestations to decide whether changed paths across a revision range are
   covered after completion.

A shared `RevisionProvider` does not make these questions interchangeable.
Verification scope is an execution-safety boundary; attestation coverage is a
provenance-coverage result. `CHANGED` or `CLAIMED` never means complete range
coverage.

### Trusted scoped checker

Differential verification uses the same provider boundary as attestation. A
project may opt into a narrow checker by declaring a schema-validated,
deterministic descriptor in `.forgeloop/config.json`:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "protocolVersion": 1,
  "complianceMode": "standard",
  "verification": {
    "checkers": [
      {
        "checkId": "unit-tests",
        "scopeMode": "PATH_ARGUMENTS",
        "argvPrefix": ["node", "--test"],
        "pathInsertion": "APPEND"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

With this descriptor, `AUTO` may resolve to `CHANGED` or `CLAIMED`. The
corresponding `run-check` invocation must contain the exact prefix followed by
the selected canonical paths:

```bash
forgeloop verify-scope --task task-001 --mode CHANGED
forgeloop run-check --task task-001 --id unit-tests \
  --requirement "unit tests" \
  --scope-ref .forgeloop/task-state/<task-key>/verification-scope.json \
  -- node --test src/example.js
```

Without a trusted descriptor, `AUTO` resolves to `FULL`; explicit `CHANGED`
and `CLAIMED` requests fail closed. A mismatched scoped argv is rejected
before the checker process starts, and successful binding records the scope
and capability fingerprints with the execution evidence.

The [Verification Trust Flow](./assets/diagrams/forgeloop-verification-trust-flow.html)
explorer and its [animated SVG fallback](./assets/diagrams/forgeloop-verification-trust-flow.svg)
show the claims, provider changes, checker capability, fingerprints, exact
argv, and observed evidence boundary. If no trusted checker exists, `AUTO`
falls back to `FULL`; an explicit `CHANGED` or `CLAIMED` request returns
`E_VERIFICATION_SCOPE_UNRESOLVED` rather than guessing.

The canonical source is `docs/diagrams/forgeloop-verification-trust-flow.workflow.json`.

## Error boundary

Providers must expose stable ForgeLoop errors rather than requiring callers to
parse command output:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `E_REVISION_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` | No selected provider can service the target. |
| `E_REVISION_PROVIDER_AMBIGUOUS` | Automatic detection found multiple providers. |
| `E_REVISION_PROVIDER_INVALID` | Provider output or contract is malformed. |
| `E_REVISION_NOT_FOUND` | The requested revision cannot be resolved. |
| `E_REVISION_CONTENT_UNAVAILABLE` | The requested path content cannot be read. |

Providers must reject unsafe or reserved paths, preserve deletion semantics,
and distinguish a missing content path from an unavailable provider. Unknown
provider semantics fail closed.

## Conformance expectations

An implementation should be tested for deterministic identity, exact bytes,
binary and empty files, Unicode and space-containing paths, symlinks,
Gitlinks, deletions, renames, path traversal, and stable error mapping.
