# Structural Quality Feedback Loop

ForgeLoop can optionally compare the structure of a project before and after a
task. The provider is an external sensor; ForgeLoop owns the policy, evidence,
lifecycle, and completion decision.

## 1. Purpose and boundaries

Structural quality answers whether the measured dependency structure changed
within the configured budget. It does not prove behavioral correctness,
security, performance, accessibility, maintainability in general, or product
quality. Tests, lint, security checks, performance checks, accessibility checks,
review, and publication remain separate evidence dimensions.

ForgeLoop persists only normalized, bounded, secret-free observations. The
resolved project path is execution context and is not written into portable
quality artifacts.

## 2. Why structural quality is not a guide

Engineering guides tell an agent how to work. A structural-quality provider
measures the result of that work. The result is therefore a typed verification
artifact and a canonical check, not an `ENG/` guide or a replacement for one.

## 3. The five metrics

Every provider observation contains integer scores from `0` through `10000`, a
finite raw value, and a canonical bottleneck. The current Sentrux adapter maps
these five root causes:

| Root cause | Meaning in the feedback loop |
| --- | --- |
| `modularity` | How cleanly responsibilities and communities are separated. |
| `acyclicity` | Whether dependency relationships remain free of prohibited cycles. |
| `depth` | The measured dependency-level depth of the project. |
| `equality` | How evenly structure is distributed across the measured modules. |
| `redundancy` | The amount of repeated or structurally redundant information. |

The aggregate `qualitySignal` is provider-supplied and normalized by ForgeLoop.
ForgeLoop does not reimplement graph analysis or claim that a high signal is a
universal software-quality score.

## 4. Delta-first policy

Gate decisions compare the current observation with the immutable baseline.
By default, the aggregate budget is zero (`maxRegressionPoints: 0`), new cycles
are forbidden (`forbidNewCycles: true`), and individual dimension budgets are
unenforced (`null`), allowing flexible dimension trade-offs as long as aggregate
signal does not regress. A configured dimension budget is intentional policy and
is bound to the baseline by a policy fingerprint.

The comparison also checks provider identity, measurement model (`measurementModel`),
compatibility key (`compatibilityKey`), task/contract/route bindings, source
material fingerprints, scan scope, provider config fingerprints, and optional
cycle/minimum conditions. Any mismatch is incomparable; it is never treated as a pass.
An explicit per-dimension failure fails the gate even when the aggregate signal improves.
Architecture-rule provenance is recorded separately and does not change Structural
Quality comparability when the measured source and provider scope are unchanged.

## 5. Modes

`structuralQuality` is absent by default for backward compatibility. When it is
present, the mode is exactly one of:

| Mode | Baseline and verification | Completion effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `off` | No provider lookup or quality artifacts. | None. |
| `observe` | Records available comparisons and visible limitations. | Never blocks completion by itself. |
| `gate` | Requires a bound baseline before execution and a comparable current-cycle pass before completion. | Missing, stale, blocked, incomparable, or failed evidence blocks the quality requirement. |

An unavailable provider is `NOT_OBSERVED` in `observe` mode and `BLOCKED` in
`gate` mode. Neither mode turns unavailable evidence into `PASS`.

## 6. Configuration examples

ForgeLoop configuration lives in `.forgeloop/config.json`.

Recommended observation mode:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "protocolVersion": 1,
  "complianceMode": "standard",
  "structuralQuality": {
    "mode": "observe",
    "provider": "sentrux"
  }
}
```

Strict gate mode with an intentional 50-point modularity budget:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "protocolVersion": 1,
  "complianceMode": "strict",
  "structuralQuality": {
    "mode": "gate",
    "provider": "sentrux",
    "maxRegressionPoints": 0,
    "dimensionBudgets": {
      "modularity": 50,
      "acyclicity": 0,
      "depth": null,
      "equality": null,
      "redundancy": null
    },
    "forbidNewCycles": true
  }
}
```

The provider name selects a registered provider only. Project configuration
cannot select an executable, shell, arbitrary arguments, score, baseline, or
provider-native command.

## 7. Baseline and verify commands

Capture the baseline after planning and before entering execution:

```bash
forgeloop quality-baseline --task <task-id> --json
```

An intentional replacement is allowed only before `EXECUTING` and retains
supersession evidence:

```bash
forgeloop quality-baseline --task <task-id> --replace --json
```

In `VERIFYING`, evaluate the current cycle:

```bash
forgeloop quality-verify --task <task-id> --json
```

Inspect persisted evidence without starting a provider:

```bash
forgeloop quality-status --task <task-id> --json
```

The JSON envelopes preserve stable structural-quality error codes and never
include raw MCP streams.

## 8. Failure-to-diagnosis workflow

When a gate evaluation fails, ForgeLoop records a failed
`structural-quality` check with the evaluation artifact, bottleneck, all
root-cause deltas, failed policy conditions, and stable reason codes. It does
not invent a diagnosis. Follow the normal lifecycle:

```text
VERIFYING
  -> DIAGNOSING  record an evidence-backed hypothesis
  -> CORRECTING  make the scoped correction
  -> VERIFYING   evaluate the new verification cycle
  -> REVIEWING   only after current-cycle evidence and other checks pass
```

Use `forgeloop next --task <task-id> --json` at each boundary. A repeated
hypothesis without new information remains subject to ForgeLoop's existing
diagnosis and stall rules.

## 9. Optional bounded optimization

Optimization is advisory and disabled by default. If enabled with
`optimization.mode: "bounded"`, ForgeLoop may recommend at most two extra
evaluations in the current verification cycle. A passing baseline comparison
already satisfies completion; extra evaluations are never required.

The recommendation is suppressed when task scope is unavailable, stale, or
outside effective claims. A gain below `minGainPoints` converges the advisory
loop, and no optimization seeks a perfect `10000` score or widens the task.

## 10. Provider contract and measurement model

The public provider boundary is vendor-neutral:

```ts
type StructuralQualityProviderInput = {
  projectPath: string;
  taskId: string;
  timeoutMs: number;
  maxOutputBytes: number;
};

type StructuralQualityProvider = {
  id: string;
  detect?(input: StructuralQualityProviderInput): Promise<Detection>;
  scan?(input: StructuralQualityProviderInput): Promise<SnapshotResult>;
  observe?(input: StructuralQualityProviderInput): Promise<SnapshotResult>;
  scopeBinding?(input: { projectPath: string }): Promise<ScopeBinding>;
};
```

Providers declare `measurementModel` (such as `structural-root-causes-v1`) and
an optional `compatibilityKey` (such as `sentrux-structural-root-causes-v1`).
When baseline and evaluation share a compatibility key, non-breaking version
differences between provider releases compare cleanly. Sentrux compatibility
is explicit: the built-in adapter accepts only verified versions `0.5.5`,
`0.5.6`, and `0.5.7`; future or malformed versions fail closed until
explicitly verified.

Runtime hosts may inject a provider through `createForgeLoopContext`. Provider
IDs are lower-case stable names matching `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$`; the built-in
`sentrux` name is reserved. Provider output is untrusted until every field is
normalized, bounded, schema-validated, and semantically bound to the task.

## 11. Sentrux MCP adapter and tool arguments

Sentrux is not a ForgeLoop npm dependency. ForgeLoop never installs, upgrades,
or selects an arbitrary Sentrux executable. The built-in adapter invokes the
trusted command name `sentrux --mcp` through a shell-free local MCP process, requires
  verified versions `0.5.5`, `0.5.6`, and `0.5.7`, and strictly conforms to Sentrux tool argument schemas:

- `scan`: `arguments: { path: "<project-path>" }`
- `health`: `arguments: {}`

Sentrux-specific configuration (such as `.sentrux/rules.toml`) is owned
exclusively by the Sentrux provider adapter via `scopeBinding()`. The adapter
records its SHA-256 as `scope.architectureRulesFingerprint` for provenance, but
the rules file is a separate Architecture Rules Sensor: changing it does not
make unchanged Structural Quality measurements incomparable. Generic provider
configuration remains a Structural Quality scope input and still invalidates
incompatible observations. The core resolver never scans for a rules file and
custom providers do not inherit this binding unless they explicitly expose their
own `scopeBinding()`.

If Sentrux is absent, preserve the resulting `NOT_OBSERVED` or `BLOCKED` state
and follow the configured mode. Install or upgrade Sentrux only through the
user's normal, separately authorized process.

The repository includes a real-provider interoperability scenario covering the
public baseline/verify path and an intentional `A -> B -> C -> A` cycle:

```bash
node --test tests/real-sentrux-structural-quality.test.js
```

The scenario runs when the user-managed `sentrux` executable reports a verified
version; environments without that external executable leave the scenario
unobserved rather than substituting a fake provider.

## 12. Sentrux Free versus optional diagnostics

The five scores, bottleneck, and the aggregate comparison are sufficient for a
structural-quality pass or fail. File-level diagnostics may be unavailable in
Sentrux Free. A missing diagnostics payload is therefore valid and remains
`null`; it does not weaken the score comparison and does not become a fake
diagnostic.

## 13. Freshness and optional observe actions

Baseline and observed `PASS`/`FAIL` artifacts must bind a stable source
fingerprint. Unreadable files, unsafe symlinks, source drift during a scan,
changed provider scope, and stale task bindings fail closed. `quality-status`,
`next`, recovery, provenance, and completion reuse the same freshness
validator and never promote a stale pass.

In `observe` mode, `next` may expose baseline or verification as optional
actions. These actions are advisory and do not spawn a provider from a
read-only status or next-action query.

## 14. Sentrux analytics are user choices

ForgeLoop does not change Sentrux's global analytics preference. If the
installed Sentrux version provides these commands, the user may inspect or
disable analytics independently:

```bash
sentrux analytics status
sentrux analytics off
```

Those commands are outside ForgeLoop evidence and should be run only with the
user's own authorization.

## 15. CI example

CI can run the same project-local commands after initializing the task and
configuring the provider on the runner:

```yaml
steps:
  - run: forgeloop preflight --task $FORGELOOP_TASK --json
  - run: forgeloop quality-baseline --task $FORGELOOP_TASK --json
  - run: forgeloop advance --task $FORGELOOP_TASK --to EXECUTING --json
  - run: forgeloop advance --task $FORGELOOP_TASK --to VERIFYING --json
  - run: forgeloop quality-verify --task $FORGELOOP_TASK --json
```

Provider installation, runner identity, and remote publication are separate
CI evidence. A green local or CI quality command does not imply a merge,
publication, or deployment.

## 16. Artifacts, locking, and projection reconciliation

Quality artifacts are task-owned and have no mutable `latest.json`:

```text
.forgeloop/task-state/<taskKey>/structural-quality/
  baseline.json
  evaluations/
    cycle-<cycle>-attempt-<attempt>.json
```

The baseline is immutable after `EXECUTING`. External provider scans execute
outside the task mutation lock to prevent starvation of concurrent operations.
Pre-scan and post-scan source material fingerprints ensure observations are
stable against mid-scan source drift (`E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_SOURCE_DRIFT`).
Provider-owned `.sentrux` configuration is excluded from source material and
is handled only by the Sentrux scope binding. Source symlinks are rejected by
the fail-closed fingerprint policy. Rules provenance is retained in the scope,
but is not folded into the Structural Quality comparison fingerprint.
If an evaluation artifact was committed but check projection was interrupted,
subsequent verification retries automatically reconcile and repair the canonical
receipt check without rescanning or incrementing attempt counts.

Portable bundles include the baseline and evaluations required for audit.
Bundle readers validate typed artifacts and fingerprints without rescanning
the project or requiring Sentrux.

## 17. Error-code troubleshooting table

| Code | Meaning | First safe action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_CONFIGURATION_INVALID` | The structural-quality configuration is malformed or outside policy limits. | Correct `.forgeloop/config.json`, then rerun `preflight`. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_PROVIDER_INVALID` | A provider contract or normalized observation is invalid. | Inspect provider integration and rerun with the same task; do not promote the observation. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` | The configured provider cannot be detected. | In observe mode continue with the limitation; in gate mode make the user-managed provider available. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_PROVIDER_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED` | The provider is older than the supported contract. | Use a user-authorized supported provider version. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_PROVIDER_PROTOCOL_INVALID` | MCP initialization, tool discovery, or response protocol is invalid. | Inspect the provider installation and keep the evidence blocked. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_PROVIDER_TOOL_CONTRACT_INVALID` | The provider tool schemas do not expose required argument definitions. | Ensure provider exposes valid `scan` and `health` MCP tool argument schemas. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_SCAN_FAILED` | The provider scan failed. | Diagnose the provider failure; never treat it as a pass. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_TIMEOUT` | The bounded provider deadline expired. | Inspect provider health and rerun only after the cause is understood. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_OUTPUT_LIMIT` | Combined provider output exceeded the safety limit. | Reduce provider verbosity or repair the provider; do not persist partial output. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_BASELINE_MISSING` | A gate task has no valid baseline. | Capture it in `PLANNED` after a valid preflight checkpoint. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_BASELINE_EXISTS` | A different baseline already exists. | Keep the immutable baseline, or use authorized `--replace` before execution. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_BASELINE_PHASE_INVALID` | Baseline replacement was attempted after execution began. | Repair against the existing baseline in a new verification cycle. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_BASELINE_BINDING_MISMATCH` | Baseline bindings no longer match the task inputs. | Inspect policy, route, provider scope, and source drift; do not bypass the binding. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_EVALUATION_INCOMPARABLE` | Current and baseline observations cannot be compared. | Resolve provider/version/policy/provider-scope drift and verify again; architecture-rule changes alone are informational. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_MEASUREMENT_MODEL_MISMATCH` | Measurement models differ between baseline and evaluation. | Ensure baseline and evaluation share a compatible measurement model. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_EVIDENCE_STALE` | A quality check is from an old cycle or points to stale evidence. | Run the current-cycle verification and record its canonical check. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_SOURCE_DRIFT` | Source material was mutated during provider observation. | Ensure worktree remains stable during quality scans and rerun verification. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_OBSERVATION_EPOCH_STALE` | Task state epoch changed during observation. | Re-run quality verification under the active task epoch. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_PROJECTION_INCOMPLETE` | Check projection was incomplete. | Re-run quality verification to reconcile the canonical check from the evaluation. |
| `E_STRUCTURAL_QUALITY_REGRESSION` | The configured aggregate, dimension, cycle, or minimum policy failed. | Record a diagnosis from the evaluation evidence and correct the scoped code. |
