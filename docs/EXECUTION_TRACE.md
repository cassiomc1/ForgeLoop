# ForgeLoop Execution Trace

Reference for `history`, `trace`, `reflect`, and task-level `inspect` observability projections (ForgeLoop 1.6.0+).

All views are deterministic read-only projections of canonical artifacts (event ledger + work state). There is no second truth store.

## history

```bash
forgeloop history --task <id> [--json] [--compact] [--verbose]
                  [--type <types>] [--phase <phases>] [--failures] [--checks]
                  [--since <ts>] [--until <ts>] [--limit <n>]
```

Human output shows chronological events with timestamps from the ledger. JSON output includes:

- `snapshot`: consistency anchors (`stateRevision`, `ledgerTailSequence`)
- `summary`: event/check/diagnostic counts
- `historyQuality`: `COMPLETE | PARTIAL | MINIMAL` with reasons
- `integrity`: ledger validation result
- `events`: normalized events (category, phase, provenance, references)

Filters are presentation-only; they never weaken integrity validation. Truncation via `--limit` is explicit (`truncated: true`).

## trace

```bash
forgeloop trace --task <id> --json
```

Machine-readable reconstruction containing events, lifecycle transitions (including `VERIFICATION_STARTED`), check attempts, diagnostics (legacy diagnoses, structured cases, interventions, dispositions), failure signatures/surfaces, executions, evidence, continuity, recovery, completion, integrity, and snapshot anchors.

Failure surfaces include every canonically verified cycle; a successful
verification appears explicitly as `surface: []`, enabling deterministic
`REDUCED -> empty` and intervention `IMPROVED` classification.

Attempt cardinality comes primarily from ledger chronology: one ledger attempt plus its state checkpoint counts once; two distinct ledger events count twice; a state-only check appears as one fallback attempt (`source: "state-fallback"`). Phases are reconstructed forward from milestone events (`TASK_RECEIVED -> RECEIVED` ... `COMPLETION_VALIDATED -> COMPLETE`); events between milestones carry derived phases (for example failed verification -> `DIAGNOSING`, recorded intervention -> `CORRECTING`) with `phaseQuality: "authoritative" | "derived" | "unknown"`. Determinism: identical canonical artifacts produce identical traces except `snapshot.capturedAt`.

## reflect

```bash
forgeloop reflect --task <id> [--json]
```

Whole-task retrospective (gain truth comes from the canonical cycle analysis;
`stallAnalysis` explains historical repetition without changing the fail-fast
stall decision): verification cycles, failure surfaces, hypothesis summary, intervention effectiveness (`PENDING | INFORMATIVE | NON_INFORMATIVE | IMPROVED | REGRESSED`), strategy fingerprints, oscillation patterns, signals, and a recommended protocol action. Deterministic — ForgeLoop does not call an LLM.

## inspect --task

`forgeloop inspect --task <id>` extends target health with an additive `taskInspection` section: snapshot, lifecycle transitions, history quality, verification attempts per requirement, diagnostic summary, progress evaluation, integrity issues, deterministic explanation reason codes, and the safe next command. Existing top-level inspect fields are unchanged.

## Read-only invariant

`history`, `trace`, `reflect`, `inspect`, `progress` never mutate protocol state, acquire ownership, or append events. Test suites enforce this by hashing the complete `.forgeloop` tree before/after invocation.

## Durable actions in the trace

`trace --json` adds an `actions` projection with totals, state and capability
counts, required/verified/failed/ambiguous counts, repeated idempotency-key
attempts, reconciliation count, and action-event count. The projection reads
the task action artifacts and the same ledger already used by history; it is
not a second source of lifecycle truth.

An action recorded as `COMMIT_UNKNOWN` is an external-state uncertainty, not a
diagnostic failure. Reflection surfaces `EXTERNAL_ACTION_RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED`
and recommends `RECONCILE_EXTERNAL_ACTION` before ordinary retry guidance.
`FORGELOOP_EXECUTED`, `HOST_REPORTED`, and `EXTERNAL_OBSERVED` remain distinct
provenance values.

`forgeloop metrics --task <id> --json` projects trajectory counts, action
outcomes, observed executions, and first/last authoritative ledger timestamps.
Usage fields remain `null` with `source: "UNKNOWN"` when the host did not
report them. `forgeloop eval --task <id> --scenario <path> --json` evaluates a
validated current trace against a project-local reference scenario; an
efficiency ratio is omitted when no positive comparable-step reference exists.
